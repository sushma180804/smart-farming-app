## 📱 About the Project

Smart Farming App is designed to empower farmers with timely and accurate agricultural information. It bridges the gap between traditional farming methods and modern technology by offering crop suggestions, hiring assistance, smart irrigation alerts, and more.

Inspired by real problems faced by my own family in agriculture, this project is built using **Flutter** and **Firebase**, with a strong focus on regional accessibility and ease of use.
